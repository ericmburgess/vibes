# vibes - Vibe coding framework for Claude Code

## Instructions

1. Copy the `vibes` and `.claude` directories into the root of your repository.
2. Run `claude` from your repository root and get to vibing.

## Note

`vibes` is intended to be used from the start of project development.
Initialization from an existing project is planned. It should be possible to
get Claude to handle everything himself by writing an appropriate set of
instructions.
