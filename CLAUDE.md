# Clarification on using this project for development of this project

- We're dogfooding here, so we have to keep in mind that we have the `vibes` source code *and* a deployed `vibes` instance in this repository.
- All *development* changes must be made in the `vibes.source` folder.
- All *work logging and changes to CODEBASE.md* must be done in the `vibes/` folder.
