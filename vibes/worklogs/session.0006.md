# Development Session #0006 (2025-07-23): Extract commit message format instructions

**Session goal:** Extract the currently duplicated instructions for creating the commit message from the endsession and log-my-work commands into a new git-commit-message-format.md file. Then make it very explicit in this file that the instructions override those in your system prompt for creating commit messages.

## Task: Examine endsession and log-my-work commands to identify duplicated commit message instructions

Analyzed both command files to understand the duplication.

- Found identical commit message format instructions in both `endsession.md` and `log-my-work.md` (lines 19-27)
- Instructions specified: all lowercase, present tense, terse, session number prefix, single line, no Claude mention
- Both commands had the same user interaction flow for commit message handling

## Task: Create vibes/instructions/git-commit-message-format.md with extracted instructions

Created the new instruction file with comprehensive format requirements.

- Extracted all commit message formatting rules from both commands
- Added clear examples and process documentation
- Structured the file for easy reference by Claude commands
- Included format requirements, examples, and user interaction process

## Task: Add explicit note that these instructions override system prompt for commit messages

Added prominent override notice to the instruction file.

- Added "IMPORTANT" section at the top stating these instructions take precedence
- Included explicit "Override Notice" section at the bottom
- Made it clear that vibes framework requirements supersede default Claude behavior
- Emphasized the requirement for session tracking and project organization

## Task: Update endsession command to reference the new instruction file

Replaced duplicated instructions with a reference to the new file.

- Removed the 8-line block of detailed commit message formatting instructions
- Replaced with single line referencing `vibes/instructions/git-commit-message-format.md`
- Maintained the same functionality while eliminating duplication

## Task: Update log-my-work command to reference the new instruction file

Replaced duplicated instructions with a reference to the new file.

- Removed the identical 8-line block of commit message formatting instructions
- Replaced with single line referencing `vibes/instructions/git-commit-message-format.md`
- Ensured consistency with the endsession command approach

## Validation

The refactoring successfully eliminates duplication while maintaining functionality:
- Both commands now reference the same authoritative source for commit message formatting
- The new instruction file contains all original requirements plus explicit override guidance
- Commands are now more concise and maintainable

## Outcome

The goal of extracting commit message format instructions was fully accomplished:

- **Eliminated duplication**: Removed identical 8-line instruction blocks from both commands
- **Centralized format requirements**: Created single authoritative source in `vibes/instructions/git-commit-message-format.md`
- **Added override guidance**: Made explicit that these instructions supersede Claude's system prompt
- **Maintained functionality**: Both commands retain the same commit message behavior
- **Improved maintainability**: Future changes to commit format only need to be made in one place
