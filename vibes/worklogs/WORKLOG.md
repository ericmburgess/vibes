# Development Session #0006 (2025-07-23): Extract commit message format instructions

## Tasks completed

✅ Extract duplicated commit message instructions into `vibes/instructions/git-commit-message-format.md`
✅ Update endsession and log-my-work commands to reference the new instruction file

## Outcome

Eliminated duplication by centralizing commit message format requirements. Added explicit override notice that vibes format supersedes Claude's system prompt behavior.

# Development Session #0005 (2025-07-23): Add vibes:log-my-work command

## Tasks completed

✅ Understand existing command structure and documentation pattern
✅ Implement vibes:log-my-work command

## Outcome

The goal of adding `vibes:log-my-work` command was fully accomplished. The command:

- Provides a way to document work-in-progress that's already staged
- Follows the same documentation workflow as `endsession`
- Integrates cleanly with the existing vibes framework structure
- Allows mid-session logging without disrupting the workflow

# Development Session #0004 (2025-07-23): Improve directory and command naming clarity

## Tasks completed

✅ Rename vibes.init to vibes.source
✅ Rename init-existing command to initialize  
✅ Improve codebase summarization template

## Outcome

The naming improvements were fully accomplished:

- **Clearer directory structure**: `vibes.source/` clearly indicates the purpose as source templates
- **Consistent command naming**: `/vibes:initialize` is more intuitive than `/vibes:init-existing`
- **Better documentation**: Enhanced template provides clearer guidance for codebase documentation
- **Updated references**: All file paths and command references updated consistently across the framework

The framework now has more intuitive naming that better communicates the purpose of each component.

# Development Session #0003 (2025-07-23): Support installation into existing codebase

## Tasks completed

✅ Create /vibes:init-existing command for codebase analysis
✅ Create git history analysis functionality  
✅ Test implementation on real project

## Outcome

Successfully implemented support for installing vibes into existing codebases:

- **Enhanced installation workflow**: Clear README instructions for existing vs new projects
- **Codebase analysis**: `/vibes:init-existing` command generates proper `CODEBASE.md` documentation
- **Historical context**: `/vibes:build-change-history` command creates `WORKLOG.md` from git history
- **Factual approach**: Commands focus on documenting what exists rather than making assumptions
- **Proven functionality**: Tested successfully on real existing codebase

Vibes can now be deployed to existing projects and automatically generate the foundational documentation needed for effective development sessions.

# Development Session #0002 (2025-07-22): Deploy script for vibes framework

## Tasks completed

✅ Understand the current vibes.init structure and what needs to be copied
✅ Create a minimal test script in scratch/ to verify copy operations
✅ Implement the full vibes-deploy shell script with validation and copying
✅ Test the deployment script on a test repository

## Outcome

Successfully created a deployment script for the vibes framework:

- Shell script handles argument validation and error checking
- Prevents accidental overwrites of existing vibes installations
- Copies all necessary template files and Claude commands
- Properly handles the `claudemd` → `CLAUDE.md` transformation
- Provides clear feedback on deployment completion

The vibes framework can now be easily deployed to any repository using `vibes-deploy <target>`.

# Development Session #0001 (2025-07-22): Initial framework setup

## Tasks completed

✅ Organize framework structure
✅ Create template system  
✅ Update documentation

## Outcome

Successfully established the vibes framework for structured development. The framework provides:

- Clear separation between sessions (major goals) and tasks (focused work units)
- Template files for consistent project setup
- Claude Code slash commands for workflow management
- Comprehensive documentation system for tracking development progress

The framework is now ready for use and dogfooding.
