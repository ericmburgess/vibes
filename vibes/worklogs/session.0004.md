# Development Session #0004 (2025-07-23): Improve directory and command naming clarity

**Session goal:** Rename directories and commands for better clarity and consistency.

## Task: Rename vibes.init to vibes.source

The original `vibes.init/` directory name was confusing as it didn't clearly indicate it contained the source templates.

- Renamed `vibes.init/` directory to `vibes.source/` to better reflect its purpose as the source template files
- Updated `vibes-deploy` script to reference the new `vibes.source/` directory path
- Updated README.md to reference the new `vibes.source/` directory name
- Updated `vibes/project/CODEBASE.md` to document the new directory structure

## Task: Rename init-existing command to initialize

The command name `init-existing` was awkward and unclear.

- Renamed `.claude/commands/vibes/init-existing.md` to `.claude/commands/vibes/initialize.md`
- Updated README.md to reference the new `/vibes:initialize` command name

## Task: Improve codebase summarization template

Enhanced the template for creating initial codebase summaries.

- Added clearer instructions for Claude distinguishing between creation vs usage instructions
- Improved formatting and examples in the summarization template
- Made the template more actionable and user-friendly

## Validation

All changes are purely file renames and path updates - no functional changes to verify.

## Outcome

The naming improvements were fully accomplished:

- **Clearer directory structure**: `vibes.source/` clearly indicates the purpose as source templates
- **Consistent command naming**: `/vibes:initialize` is more intuitive than `/vibes:init-existing`
- **Better documentation**: Enhanced template provides clearer guidance for codebase documentation
- **Updated references**: All file paths and command references updated consistently across the framework

The framework now has more intuitive naming that better communicates the purpose of each component.
