# Development Session #0002 (2025-07-22): Deploy script for vibes framework

**Session goal:** Create a `vibes-deploy <repo root>` script for adding `vibes` to a repository

## Task: Understand the current vibes.init structure and what needs to be copied

- Analyzed the `vibes.init/` directory structure containing template files
- Identified that `vibes.init/vibes/` contains project templates
- Found `vibes.init/.claude/` contains Claude commands for the framework
- Discovered `vibes.init/vibes/claudemd` is the source for target `CLAUDE.md`

## Task: Create a minimal test script in scratch/ to verify copy operations

- Created `scratch/test-deploy.sh` to validate copy operations
- Tested copying `vibes.init/vibes` and `vibes.init/.claude` directories
- Verified `claudemd` content gets copied to `CLAUDE.md` correctly
- Confirmed all expected files are present in test deployment

## Task: Implement the full vibes-deploy shell script with validation and copying

- Created `/Users/eric/dev/git/vibes/vibes-deploy` executable script
- Added validation to check target directory exists
- Implemented checks to prevent overwriting existing `vibes/` or `.claude/commands/vibes/`
- Script copies `vibes.init/vibes` (excluding `claudemd`) to target
- Script copies `vibes.init/.claude` to target
- Script creates `CLAUDE.md` from `claudemd` content

## Task: Test the deployment script on a test repository

- Successfully tested deployment to `/tmp/test-deploy-target`
- Verified `claudemd` file is not copied to target
- Confirmed `CLAUDE.md` is created with correct content
- All expected directories and files deployed correctly

## Validation

```bash
# Test deployment
/Users/eric/dev/git/vibes/vibes-deploy /tmp/test-deploy-target

# Verify structure
find /tmp/test-deploy-target -type f
ls -la /tmp/test-deploy-target/vibes/CLAUDE.md
```

## Outcome

Successfully created a deployment script for the vibes framework:

- Shell script handles argument validation and error checking
- Prevents accidental overwrites of existing vibes installations
- Copies all necessary template files and Claude commands
- Properly handles the `claudemd` â†’ `CLAUDE.md` transformation
- Provides clear feedback on deployment completion

The vibes framework can now be easily deployed to any repository using `vibes-deploy <target>`.
