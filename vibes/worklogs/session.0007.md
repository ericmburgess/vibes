# Development Session #0007 (2025-07-23): Improve installation and source templates

**Session goal:** Enhance installation script and update source template files.

## Task: Improve installation script

- Updated `install` script to use `realpath` for proper path resolution
- Enhanced output formatting with better messaging and structure  
- Added instruction to run `/vibes:initialize` after installation for project setup
- Improved user experience with clearer feedback about installation steps

## Task: Update source template files

- Updated `vibes.source/.claude/commands/vibes/initialize.md` to prompt user to run `/vibes:build-change-history` instead of suggesting additional documentation
- Updated `vibes.source/.claude/commands/vibes/log-my-work.md` to specify that command stages the vibes directory (`git add vibes`)

## Validation

The install script now provides better path handling and user guidance. Source templates are updated to match current framework expectations.

## Outcome

Installation and source template improvements were fully accomplished:

- **Better installation experience**: Script uses proper path resolution and provides clear next steps
- **Updated templates**: Source files reflect current command behavior and workflow
- **Consistent framework**: Templates match deployed command specifications

The installation process is now more robust and user-friendly.
