# Development Session #0001 (2025-07-22): Initial framework setup

**Session goal:** Establish the vibes framework for structured Claude Code development.

## Task: Organize framework structure

- Moved Claude commands from root `.claude/commands/` to namespaced `.claude/commands/vibes/`
- Replaced `/plan` command with `/vibes:task` for clearer workflow
- Added `/vibes:help` command for framework documentation

## Task: Create template system

- Established `vibes.init/` as template source for new projects
- Created documentation templates in `vibes.init/vibes/instructions/`
- Added project structure templates (CODEBASE.md, TODO.md, WORKLOG.md)
- Included framework usage guide in `vibes-help.md`

## Task: Update documentation

- Updated CODEBASE.md to document the framework structure
- Focused documentation on `vibes.init/` source code templates
- Documented design principles: session-based workflow and task decomposition

## Outcome

Successfully established the vibes framework for structured development. The framework provides:

- Clear separation between sessions (major goals) and tasks (focused work units)
- Template files for consistent project setup
- Claude Code slash commands for workflow management
- Comprehensive documentation system for tracking development progress

The framework is now ready for use and dogfooding.
