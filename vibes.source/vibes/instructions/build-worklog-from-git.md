# Building Worklog from Git History

Instructions for Claude on how to analyze git history and create an initial `WORKLOG.md` for an existing project.

## Purpose

When vibes is installed in an existing project, generate a `WORKLOG.md` that summarizes the development history based on git commits rather than leaving it blank.

## Process

### 1. Analyze Git History

- **Read recent commit history** using `git log --oneline -20` (or more if needed)
- **Group commits by themes** - look for related work (features, bug fixes, refactoring)
- **Identify major milestones** - initial commits, version tags, significant changes
- **Note development patterns** - frequency, commit message style, branching

### 2. Generate WORKLOG Summary

Create `vibes/worklogs/WORKLOG.md` with:

**Header section:**
- Project name and brief description
- Date range of git history analyzed
- Note that this is generated from git history

**Development History section:**
- **Major milestones** in chronological order (initial commit, major features, releases)
- **Recent development themes** based on commit patterns
- **Key contributors** if multiple authors are evident

**Example format:**
```markdown
# Development History (Generated from Git Log)

*This worklog was generated by analyzing git commit history on [date]*

## Major Milestones

- **[date]** - Initial project setup (commit: abc123)
- **[date]** - Added authentication system (commits: def456-ghi789)
- **[date]** - Implemented core API endpoints (commits: jkl012-mno345)

## Recent Development Themes

- **Bug fixes and maintenance** (last 2 weeks)
- **Performance optimizations** (commits pqr678-stu901)
- **Documentation updates** (various commits)

## Notes

This summary provides context for future vibes sessions. Individual session logs will be created going forward.
```

### 3. Guidelines

- **Be factual** - only document what's evident in commits
- **Don't speculate** about session boundaries or developer intent
- **Keep it concise** - this is orientation material, not comprehensive history
- **Focus on structure** - help Claude understand the project's evolution
- **Preserve git information** - include relevant commit hashes for reference

## What NOT to do

- Don't create individual session files (session.NNNN.md)
- Don't assume session goals from commit messages
- Don't make up development methodology details
- Don't analyze code changes in detail - just themes and milestones
