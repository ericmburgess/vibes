DOCUMENTING A WORK SESSION
--------------------------

To document a completed work session, do the following, in the same format and detail
level as illustrated in the samples below.

- Determine next session ID by reading the most recent entry in `vibes/worklogs/WORKLOG.md`
    - If the file is empty, use "0000".
- Document the work done in a new `vibes/worklogs/session.1234.md` file.
- Add an entry to the work log at `vibes/worklogs/WORKLOG.md`. Add the entry at
  the TOP.
- If needed, revise `vibes/CODDEBASE.md` to reflect changes made. KEEP IT BRIEF!

SAMPLE SESSION LOG
------------------

# Development Session #1234 (2027-07-22): Streamlining authentication

**Session goal:** Allow authentication with username/password instead of JWT token.

## Task: Understand how to retrieve the JWT token

Before making any changes to the codebase, first understand how to do it.

- Wrote a test script at `scratch/test_auth.py` as a minimal proof of concept, which
    - Builds the Auth0 URL for the selected environment.
    - Retrieves the JWT token from Auth0 using the username/password.
- The script worked, retrieving the token as required.

## Task: Implement token retrieval in the main project

- Implemented the same logic in the main project, in a new `api.authentication` module.
- Added --username and --password command-line options.
- Tested by running with --username and --password options.
  
## Task: Automatic token refreshing

When the JWT token expires, retrieve a new one automatically

- Created a new `api.session.Session` class as the central HTTP handling layer.
- Replaced duplicated code in command handlers with a call to `Session.request`.
- Upon 401/403 error, a new token is now automatically retrieved, and the request
  is re-sent and the results returned to the caller.

## Validation

```bash
# Username/password authentication
python -m my_project.cli --username user@example.com --password P@ssw0rd 

# API functionality verification
echo "/list" | python -m my_project.cli --username user@example.com --password P@ssw0rd 
```

## Outcome

The goal of streamlining authentication was fully accomplished. The UX for
authentication was greatly improved:

- The user is no longer required to manually fetch the JWT token.
- Token expiration is handled transparently.

(It could be that the original goal was only partly accomplished. If so, describe
what was achieved and what was not.)
